But two-thirds of it isn’t; and, in recent years, the neuroscience field has become more acutely aware of the incredible importance of the roles played by those other sorts of cells.\nOne of those other thirds is made up of astrocytes—. Astrocytes form a cellular network woven between the neurons, …\n\nAstrocyte calcium dynamics\nOne absolutely crucial"

The full atdata ecosystem is architected to go one step further, placing metadata for type schemas of scientific datasets—and the code for these lenses between them—in a public, decentralized repository on ATProto, the protocol layer underlying the Bluesky social network. This allows AI coding agents on data science tasks to automatically leverage domain knowledge of structured semantic relationships to decide what data to pull from for a given task.More on atdata soon—sign up for updates to hear first as we push more features to the public release!\n\n\nThe data\n…"
